# Zomato-Restaurant-Analysis
I built a zomato restaurant analysis dashboard using Excel, Power BI, and Tableau. The dashboard utilized data retrieved from a MySQL database and provided insights into restaurant statistics, ratings, and trends. I cleaned and prepared the data for analysis. The dashboard featured a country map table, a calendar table showing restaurant openings by year, quarter, and month, and interactive visualizations for exploring restaurant data by city, cuisine, ratings, and more. The project enabled stakeholders to make data-driven decisions and resulted in improved strategic planning for restaurant owners and managers. It enhanced my skills in data analysis, visualization, and database management.
